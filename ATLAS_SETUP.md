# 🚀 EASY SETUP - Using MongoDB Atlas (No Installation!)

## ⚡ Quick Setup with Cloud Database (5 minutes)

Since MongoDB is not installed locally, let's use **MongoDB Atlas** - it's **completely FREE** and much easier!

---

## Step 1: Create Free MongoDB Atlas Account

1. **Go to:** https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. **Sign up** with Google or email (FREE)
3. Click **"Build a Database"**
4. Select **"M0 FREE"** tier
5. Choose a cloud provider (any is fine)
6. Click **"Create"**

---

## Step 2: Setup Database Access

1. **Create Database User:**
   - Username: `etcpuser`
   - Password: `etcppassword123` (or create your own)
   - Click **"Create User"**

2. **Add Your IP Address:**
   - Click **"Add My Current IP Address"**
   - Or click **"Allow Access from Anywhere"** (for development)
   - Click **"Finish and Close"**

---

## Step 3: Get Connection String

1. Click **"Connect"** button
2. Choose **"Connect your application"**
3. Copy the connection string (looks like this):
   ```
   mongodb+srv://etcpuser:<password>@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
4. Replace `<password>` with your actual password

## Step 4: Update Your Backend

Open `backend/.env` file and update the MongoDB URI:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://etcpuser:etcppassword123@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/etcp?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
```

**Replace** the MONGODB_URI with your connection string from Atlas!

## Step 5: Restart Backend & Seed Database

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the backend folder
cd "C:\Users\Pasindu Isuranga\Desktop\New folder (2)\backend"

# Seed the database with demo users
node seedDatabase.js

# You should see:
# ✓ Created demo traveler
# ✓ Created demo provider user
# ✓ Created provider profile
# Database seeded successfully!

# Start the backend server
npm start

# You should see:
# MongoDB Connected: cluster0-shard...
# ETCP Backend server running on port 5000
```

## Step 6: Open Your Application

**Open browser:** http://localhost:3000

You'll see the **login page**! 🎉

## 🔑 Login Credentials

### Traveler Account:
```
Email: traveler@demo.com
Password: demo123
```

### Provider Account:
```
Email: provider@demo.com
Password: demo123
```

## ✅ That's It!

Your platform is now running with:
- ✅ Cloud database (MongoDB Atlas)
- ✅ Backend API running
- ✅ Frontend running
- ✅ Demo accounts ready
- ✅ All features working!

## 🎯 Quick Test

1. Login as **traveler** → See Discovery Hub, Journeys, Voyager
2. Logout → Login as **provider** → See Dashboard, Analytics, Reviews, etc.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to Atlas?
- Check your connection string is correct
- Make sure you replaced `<password>` with actual password
- Verify your IP is whitelisted (or use "Allow from Anywhere")

### "Authentication failed"?
- Double-check username and password in connection string
- Make sure database user was created in Atlas

### Still getting errors?
- Copy the FULL error message
- Check the connection string has `etcp` as database name
- Example: `...mongodb.net/etcp?retryWrites=true...`
